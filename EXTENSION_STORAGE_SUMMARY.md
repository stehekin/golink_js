# Extension Storage Configuration Implementation

## Overview
Added extension storage as a configurable option for managing golinks. Users can now choose between using a golink service or extension storage through the options page.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Storage Manager (`storage-manager.js`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized storage management with user-configurable storage mode
- **Features**:
  - User-configurable storage mode selection
  - Consistent API for both storage methods
  - Pagination support for extension storage
  - Full CRUD operations for both storage methods
  - Automatic mode detection from user settings

### 2. Updated Background Script (`background.js`)
- **Changes**:
  - Imports storage-manager.js using `importScripts()`
  - Replaced direct service API calls with storage manager
  - Simplified golink resolution logic

### 3. Updated Popup (`popup.js`, `popup.html`)
- **Changes**:
  - Added storage-manager.js script inclusion
  - Replaced service calls with storage manager methods
  - Improved error handling for both storage methods
  - Unified create/update golink functionality

### 4. Updated Management Interface (`manage.js`, `manage.html`)
- **Changes**:
  - Added storage-manager.js script inclusion
  - Replaced service calls with storage manager methods
  - Maintained pagination functionality for both storage types
  - Improved error messaging

### 5. Enhanced Options Page (`options.js`, `options.html`)
- **Changes**:
  - Added storage mode selection radio buttons
  - Service URL section shows/hides based on storage mode
  - Validates service URL only when service mode is selected
  - Saves storage mode preference to chrome.storage.sync

## Storage Schema

### Extension Storage Format
```javascript
{
  "golinks": {
    "go/example": {
      "short_link": "go/example",
      "url": "https://example.com"
    },
    // ... more golinks
  }
}
```

## Behavior

### Service Mode Selected
- All operations use the configured golink service
- Requires valid service URL in configuration
- Existing service functionality remains unchanged
- Network connectivity required for operations

### Extension Storage Mode Selected
- All operations use chrome.storage.local
- Golinks are stored in extension's local storage
- Works completely offline
- No external service dependency required
- User experience remains consistent

## Compatibility
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing service API
- No changes to user interface or workflow
- User can switch between storage modes at any time
- Extension works offline when using extension storage mode

## Files Modified
1. `storage-manager.js` (new)
2. `background.js`
3. `popup.js`
4. `popup.html`
5. `manage.js`
6. `manage.html`
7. `options.js`
8. `options.html`

## Configuration Options
- **Storage Mode**: Choose between "Use Golink Service" and "Use Extension Storage (Offline)"
- **Service URL**: Configurable when using service mode (hidden when using extension storage)
- Settings are saved to chrome.storage.sync and persist across browser sessions

## Testing Recommendations
1. Configure service mode and test all golink operations
2. Configure extension storage mode and test all golink operations
3. Test switching between modes and verify data isolation
4. Verify golink resolution works in both modes
5. Test that service URL field shows/hides appropriately
6. Test settings persistence across browser restarts
